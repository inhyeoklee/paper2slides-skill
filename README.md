## Overview

`paper2slides` is an agent skill that reads a scientific paper, extracts its figures, and produces a ready-to-present [Reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/) slide deck with speaker notes.

It works in two layers:

| Layer | Role | Implementation |
|-------|------|----------------|
| **Extraction** | Pull figures from the PDF, segment into panels | Python library (`paper2slides`) |
| **Curation** | Read the paper, select key figures, write slide content and speaker notes | The agent |

The extraction step is mechanical — it gives you all the raw material. The agent then does what a human presenter would: reads the paper, decides what matters, and builds a coherent narrative.

## Installation

### 1. Add the skill to your workspace

```bash
git clone https://github.com/inhyeoklee/paper2slides-skill.git

# Copy into your workspace
cp -r paper2slides-skill/skill/ YOUR_WORKSPACE/.agent/skills/paper2slides/
cp paper2slides-skill/workflow/paper2slides.md YOUR_WORKSPACE/.agent/workflows/
```

### 2. Install the Python library

```bash
cd paper2slides-skill/library
pip install -e .
```

Requires Python 3.9+ and installs PyMuPDF, Pillow, NumPy, Jinja2, and Click.

## How It Works

```mermaid

    A[Paper PDF] --> B[paper2slides CLI]
    B --> C[Panel Images]
    A --> D[Agent reads text]
    C --> E[Agent curates slides]
    D --> E
    E --> F[Slide Deck + Speaker Notes]
```

### Workflow

1. **Extract** — `paper2slides paper.pdf -o output/` pulls figures at 4× DPI and segments them into individual panels
2. **Read** — The agent extracts and reads the paper text to understand the structure, results, and narrative
3. **Curate** — The agent selects the most important panels, writes slide titles and captions, and composes speaker notes
4. **Verify** — The agent opens the deck in a browser to check rendering

## Usage

Tell the agent:

```
/paper2slides

Create a presentation from: path/to/paper.pdf
```

Or use the CLI directly for just the extraction step:

```bash
paper2slides paper.pdf -o ./output --serve
```
